    --------------------- Cohort - simple C test runner -----------------------
    ===========================================================================

   This is a casual testing module and functionality is deliberately left basic. 
   Having a full-blown test framework that is complicated to use is often a
   deterrent from testing one's code. This module aims to be convenient and 
   extremely simple to use, without any bells and whistles. The best way to use
   this is to put the tests in a file and compile and run it when building
   the program e.g. with make by way of sanity-testing it.

   
   Features and functionality
   ---------------------------

   In a nutshell, the module offers a test runner that will iterate over a linked 
   list and execute each test registered there. A per-test as well as an overall 
   report is printed to stdout summarizing the tests that ran and which ones failed
   /passed. 

   * Each test should be in its own self-contained function. The function should return
     an e_status enum, with possible members being SUCCESS or FAILURE, and take no
     arguments.
   * Each test must be registered with the test runner list. At the end, the test runner
     gets called on the list to execute each registered test in turn.

   Usage
   -----------------------
   * Initialize a 'list' with Cohort_init().
   * Add pointers to test functions to be called to the test list using `Cohort_add()`.
   * Execute all the tests in the list with `Cohort_decimate()`.
   * All the function tests that are to be registered to be called
     should return 0 (enum status SUCCESS) on success and 1 (enum status FAILURE)
     on failure.
